### Documentation
- correct polluted changelog entries for the 2026-08-01 release (#38)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- `self-assess-autopilot`/`self-assess-status`: staleness tracking (`staleness.py`) and richer status reporting (`status.py`, `self_assess_cli.py`) (#32)
- Ten auditor agents plus `business-rules-miner` gained fenced worked-example output formats in place of prose-only schemas, grounded in their actual validator code (#33)
- `self-assess-extract-rules`: three-file schema/example/rendered-report split under `references/` (#33)

### Removed
- Dead `version: 0.1.0` field from all 16 `SKILL.md` files (never a real Claude Code field, never bumped since scaffolding) (#33)

### Changed
- README: add a "Why this exists" section ahead of mechanism (#33)
- Agents' `tools:` frontmatter standardized onto the documented comma-string form (#33)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- Corrected `plugin.json`'s version, which had regressed to `0.1.0` when this
  plugin was rebuilt from its behavior specification (repo commit `0c10fa0`),
  silently overwriting the real version already published as
  `self-assess-v0.3.0` on 2026-07-25. No functional or content change beyond
  this correction.

### Added
- README: new `## Install` section (previously had none) and a new
  `## Example Prompts` section with real, verified prompt-to-skill examples,
  replacing the old terse arrow-mapped `## Typical usage` table that was
  buried as the last section of the file; `## Design decisions` heading
  wording already matched the other five plugins (#14).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Initial release, generated from a behavior specification via `tools/plugin-serializer/`.
